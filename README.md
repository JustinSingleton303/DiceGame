# DiceGame
A webpage game where the winner is determined by the higher roll between 2 dice.  Uses DOM to manipulate the various parts of the HTML document in combination with
JavaScript that does the straight up calculation functions.  Nice little challange by Udemy's 2021 web development bootcamp.
